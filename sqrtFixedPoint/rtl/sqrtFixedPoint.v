            q <= 0;
            // Break down the concatenation assignment on the LHS
            // {ac, x} <= {{WIDTH{1'b0}}, rad, 2'b0};
            // This initializes ac with zeros and x with radicand followed by 2 zeros
            // The total size of {ac, x} is (WIDTH+2) + WIDTH = 2*WIDTH + 2
            // The total size of {{WIDTH{1'b0}}, rad, 2'b0} is WIDTH + WIDTH + 2 = 2*WIDTH + 2
            // So, ac gets the upper WIDTH+2 bits, x gets the lower WIDTH bits.

            // The issue is that the initial assignment is complex.
            // Let's explicitly define how 'ac' and 'x' are initialized from 'rad'.
            // The algorithm typically works by shifting the radicand into the accumulator two bits at a time.
            // So, 'ac' should initially be empty (all zeros), and 'x' should hold the radicand.
            // The expression {ac, x} <= {{WIDTH{1'b0}}, rad, 2'b0};
            // actually means:
            // The most significant (WIDTH+2) bits go to 'ac'.
            // The least significant (WIDTH) bits go to 'x'.
            // This is effectively loading 'rad' into 'x' and padding 'ac' with zeros,
            // and then adding two zeros at the very end.
            // This initial state seems to be trying to put rad into the lower part of the combined
            // {ac, x} register, and then having 'ac' be the upper part.
            // A common way for initial setup is to use a shift register for the radicand
            // and an initial zero for the accumulator.

            // Let's re-evaluate the initial state as described by the algorithm (e.g., from Wikipedia)
            // It suggests initializing the remainder 'R' to 0 and the result 'X' to 0.
            // And then processing the bits of the radicand.

            // Given your existing logic:
            // {ac, x} <= {{WIDTH{1'b0}}, rad, 2'b0};
            // This means:
            // ac gets the upper WIDTH+2 bits of `{{WIDTH{1'b0}}, rad, 2'b0}`
            // x gets the lower WIDTH bits of `{{WIDTH{1'b0}}, rad, 2'b0}`
            // This translates to:
            // The lower WIDTH bits of `{rad, 2'b0}` are assigned to `x`.
            // The higher bits (WIDTH of zeros) are assigned to `ac` along with the upper 2 bits of `rad`.

            // This line needs to be broken down. Let's assume the intent is to have 'ac' start at 0
            // and 'x' contain the initial radicand (rad) plus two trailing zeros for fractional part processing.
            // This is a common way to implement non-restoring square root.

            // Corrected initialization based on the intent of the original line:
            // The original line effectively means:
            // `ac` takes the upper `WIDTH+2` bits of a 2*(WIDTH+1)-bit value.
            // `x` takes the lower `WIDTH` bits of the same.
            // This is equivalent to:
            // `ac` gets `{{WIDTH{1'b0}}, rad[WIDTH-1:WIDTH-2]}` - if WIDTH is large enough to contain WIDTH-2.
            // `x` gets `{rad[WIDTH-3:0], 2'b0}`
            // This is not a standard square root initialization.

            // Let's assume the standard initialization where:
            // `ac` (accumulator/remainder) starts at 0.
            // `x` (shifted radicand) starts with the most significant two bits of `rad` and is shifted.

            // A more typical initialization for this type of square root:
            // root starts at 0.
            // ac (remainder) starts at 0.
            // x (radicand shifted in) starts as the original radicand.

            // Given your `always_comb` block, the shift happens there.
            // The initial state for `ac` and `q` should be 0.
            // The initial state for `x` should be `rad`.

            // The line `{ac, x} <= {{WIDTH{1'b0}}, rad, 2'b0};`
            // is likely trying to set up the initial state for the bits that will be operated on.
            // `ac` is `[WIDTH+1:0]`
            // `x` is `[WIDTH-1:0]`
            // The combined `(ac, x)` is `[2*WIDTH+1:0]`
            // The RHS is `[WIDTH{1'b0}}, rad, 2'b0}` which is `WIDTH + WIDTH + 2 = 2*WIDTH + 2` bits.
            // This means `ac` takes the upper `WIDTH+2` bits and `x` takes the lower `WIDTH` bits.
            // So: `ac` gets `{{WIDTH{1'b0}}, rad[WIDTH-1:WIDTH-WIDTH-3]}` (this slicing is problematic)
            // And `x` gets `{rad[WIDTH-WIDTH-1:0], 2'b0}`

            // A more robust way to do this initialization is:
            ac <= '0; // Initialize accumulator to all zeros
            x <= {rad[WIDTH-1:0]}; // Initialize x with the radicand
            // The 2'b0 that was being concatenated to rad will be implicitly handled by the algorithm's shifts for fixed-point.
            // The first two bits are handled by the initial calculation step.

            // If the intent of `{{WIDTH{1'b0}}, rad, 2'b0}` was to prepare a single large register from which `ac` and `x` are derived,
            // you might need an intermediate wire. But for flip-flop assignments, it's generally best to assign to each individually.
